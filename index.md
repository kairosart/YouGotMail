## Scenario

You are a penetration tester who has recently been requested to perform a security assessment for Brik. You are permitted to perform active assessments on `MACHINE_IP` and strictly passive reconnaissance on [brownbrick.co](https://brownbrick.co/). The scope includes only the domain and IP provided and does not include other TLDs.

To begin, start the Virtual Machine by pressing the Start Machine button at the top of this task. You may access the VM using the AttackBox or your VPN connection. Please allow 3-4 minutes for the VM to fully boot up.
