As you can see on the *nmap* enumeration you have a 3389 port to connect via RDP.

With the credentials you already have connect to the server.

#Attacking_machine 
```
xfreerdp3 /u:wrohit /p:superstar /v:<MACHINE IP>
```

![[RDP-20250825193234301.webp]]


## User wrohit's privileges

#Windows_command
Run the following on a terminal:

```
net user wrohit
```

![[RDP-20250825200427716.webp]]

You can see *wrohit*  is a member of the `Local Administrators` group, so he  has all necessary privileges for further exploitation.

From here you can answer some questions.
