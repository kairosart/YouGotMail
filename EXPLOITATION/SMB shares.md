## Enumerating shares

You need go know what shares are on the server.

#Attacking_machine 
```
smbclient -U wrohit%superstar -L //<MACHINE IP>
```

![[SMB shares-20250825192059685.webp]]

So right now you only see the **default administrative shares**:

- `ADMIN$` â†’ remote admin (Windows system folder, usually not accessible)
    
- `C$` â†’ hidden share of the whole C: drive (needs Administrator)
    
- `IPC$` â†’ inter-process communication (used for null sessions, not useful for files)
    

ðŸ‘‰ With the creds `wrohit:superstar`, you donâ€™t have enough rights to read those â€” thatâ€™s why no user file shares are showing.


**Next step:** [[RDP]]
